Hello! Iâ€™m CatalinaðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate coder with a love for music and an eagerness to learn new things every day. Iâ€™ve explored various projects, including a music website I created for a school project that features my own compositions. Currently, I'm diving into a Raspberry Pi ad blocker project, combining my interests in coding and electronics.

My journey also includes experience with C embedded programming, where Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to tackle some exciting challenges. I believe in the power of collaboration and creativity, and Iâ€™m always open to new ideas and opportunities.

Feel free to check out my projects, and letâ€™s connect!
